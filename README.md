# Draft Council Reports

Draft reports for W3C councils that I'm chairing

* [RDF-star charter](https://jyasskin.github.io/draft-council-reports/rdf-star-council-report.html)

Reports are started as copies of the template at
https://github.com/w3c/AB-public/tree/main/council-templates, of which you can see a preview at
https://w3c.github.io/AB-public/council-report-template.


Build by [installing Bikeshed](https://speced.github.io/bikeshed/#install-normal), and then use
`bikeshed spec <report.bs>`, `bikeshed watch <report.bs>`, or `bikeshed serve <report.bs>`.
